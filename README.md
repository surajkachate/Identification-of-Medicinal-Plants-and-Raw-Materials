# Identification of Different Medicinal Plants/Raw materials through Image Processing Using Machine Learning Algorithms

Traditional healthcare, rooted in practices like Ayurveda, faces challenges in identifying diverse medicinal plants. This study assesses cutting-edge algorithms, including YOLOv8, for real-time plant identification. Leveraging advanced image processing and machine learning, the research aims to enhance accuracy, addressing challenges in Ayurvedic Pharmaceutics. Specifically, the paper explores YOLOv8's potential as a robust tool for identifying medicinal plants and raw materials. The comparative analysis provides insights into its efficacy, emphasizing the intersection of traditional knowledge and technology for improved healthcare practices.
